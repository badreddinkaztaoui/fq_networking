### 1. What is an IP?
- **IP (Internet Protocol):** IP is a set of rules that govern the format of data sent over the Internet or networks. An **IP address** is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It allows devices to communicate and identify each other on a network.

### 2. What are the types of an IP address?
- There are two main types of IP addresses: **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)** and **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses. The transition to IPv6 is necessary due to the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses. ([Reference](https://www.internetsociety.org/))

### 3. What is the purpose of IP addresses?
- The primary purpose of IP addresses is to uniquely identify devices on a network. They enable data packets to be routed from the source to the destination across the Internet or any network that uses the Internet Protocol.

### 4. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
- The main differences include address length (32-bit for IPv4 and 128-bit for IPv6), address notation (dotted decimal for IPv4 and hexadecimal with colons for IPv6), and address space (limited for IPv4 and vast for IPv6). IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and provide a more extensive address pool. ([Reference](https://www.internetsociety.org/))

| Feature                 | IPv4                  | IPv6                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Address Length          | 32 bits               | 128 bits                   |
| Address Notation        | Dotted Decimal Notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1) | Hexadecimal Notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334) |
| Address Space           | Limited (4.3 billion addresses) | Vast (2^128 addresses)     |
| Subnetting              | Common                  | Integral Part of Address   |
| Broadcast              | Yes                   | No (replaced by multicast) |
| NAT (Network Address Translation) | Common          | Less Common                |

### 5. What is TCP/IP?
- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols that facilitates the transmission of data between devices on the Internet. It provides a standardized framework for addressing, transmitting, and routing data across networks.

### 6. What is the difference between TCP and IP?
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** TCP is responsible for ensuring the reliable delivery of data packets. It establishes a connection, manages data flow, and performs error checking. **IP (Internet Protocol):** IP handles the addressing and routing of data packets. Together, TCP and IP form the basis of the TCP/IP protocol suite. ([Reference](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791))

### 7. How does TCP/IP exactly work?
- TCP/IP operates through a layered architecture. Data is passed down through layers on the sender's side and up through layers on the receiver's side. The layers include the link layer, network layer, transport layer (TCP or UDP), and application layer. ([Reference](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1122))

### 8. What is a switch?
- A **switch** is a network device that operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It uses MAC addresses to forward data only to the specific device on the network to which the data is intended, enhancing network efficiency. ([Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/ethernet/10000-8rings.html))

### 9. What is a router?
- A **router** is a network device that operates at the network layer (Layer 3). Routers connect different networks and determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination. They use IP addresses for routing decisions. ([Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html))

### 10. How does a router work?
- Routers use routing tables to make decisions on how to forward data packets between different networks. They analyze the destination IP address of a packet and choose the most appropriate path based on the available routes. ([Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html))

### 11. What is the difference between a Modem and a Router?
- A **modem** (modulator-demodulator) converts digital data from a computer into analog signals for transmission over analog communication lines and vice versa. A **router** connects networks and directs data packets between them, handling the routing of data based on IP addresses. ([Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/broadband-cable/cable-modems/14861-modem-router-difference.html))

### 12. What is a loopback address?
- A **loopback address** (usually 127.0.0.1) is a special IP address that allows a device to send and receive data to itself. It is often used for testing network connectivity on a local device. ([Reference](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3330))

### 13. What is a subnet?
- A **subnet** is a logical subdivision of an IP network. It allows network administrators to divide an IP address space into smaller, more manageable segments for organizational or security reasons. ([Reference](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc950))

### 14. How to calculate a subnet mask from an IP address step by step?
- To calculate a subnet mask, identify the network portion of the IP address. Subtract this from 32 (for IPv4), convert to dotted-decimal notation for the subnet mask. ([Reference](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr))
